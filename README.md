DEVOPS STUDY PLANNER

Welcome to the devops study planner â€” a simple, beginner-friendly tool I built to help learners like myself stay focused and consistent while navigating the world of DevOps.

This is a fully static web app that lets you check off core topics as you learn them, track your progress visually, and stay motivated with a clean UI.

WHTAT'S INSIDE?

-  A checklist of essential DevOps topics
-  A live progress bar that updates as you check things off
-  Progress is saved in your browser automatically
-  Dark mode toggle for late-night study sessions
-  A fun popup when you complete the whole list

BUILD WITH:

- HTML, CSS, and JavaScript
- LocalStorage for saving your progress

The Study planner looks like this:
